        I`ve made this game as mine diploma for college in May, 2020.
        I`ve been inspired by COVID-19 pandemic because a lot of people,
        including me had to work from home but had a little bits of time between different work calls and etc.
        So I have decided to make some kind of simple, relaxing and entertaining game, which wouldn`t be demanding to computer resources,
        so you can keep it working in browser tab.<br>
        So please enjoy this game, hope you will like it.
        <br><br>
        Also contact me and give me more ideas for splash text in the main menu, if you have such ;)
